# Storage Feedback Requirements

## Overview
A confirmation popup that appears after workout completion to inform users whether their workout was successfully saved or failed to save. The popup displays for 5 seconds and auto-dismisses, providing clear feedback about the storage operation outcome.

## User Stories

### STORY-001: Successful Workout Storage Confirmation
As a workout user
I want to see confirmation when my workout is saved successfully
So that I know my workout data has been preserved

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I complete a workout, when the workout stops and saves successfully, then I see a popup displaying "Workout saved successfully"
2. Given the success popup appears, when 5 seconds pass, then the popup automatically dismisses
3. Given the success confirmation shows, when I observe the message, then it provides clear positive feedback about the save operation
4. Given the workout save completes, when the confirmation appears, then it happens in the same flow as the stop operation without delay

### STORY-002: Failed Workout Storage Notification
As a workout user
I want to be notified when my workout fails to save
So that I'm aware the data was not preserved

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I complete a workout, when the workout stops and saving fails, then I see a popup displaying "Failed to save workout"
2. Given the failure popup appears, when 5 seconds pass, then the popup automatically dismisses
3. Given the save operation fails, when the error popup shows, then it provides clear notification of the failure
4. Given the workout save fails, when the notification appears, then it happens in the same flow as the stop operation without delay

### STORY-003: Popup Behavior and Timing
As a workout user
I want the storage feedback to be unobtrusive but informative
So that I get the information I need without blocking my workflow

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given any storage feedback popup appears, when I observe the timing, then it remains visible for exactly 5 seconds
2. Given the popup is displayed, when the timer completes, then it dismisses automatically without user interaction
3. Given the storage operation completes, when the popup appears, then there is no intermediate "saving..." state shown
4. Given the stop operation is triggered, when storage feedback is needed, then it integrates seamlessly into the existing stop workflow

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Popup should be visually distinct from other UI elements
- Success and failure messages should be clearly differentiated (color, styling)
- Auto-dismiss timing should be precise (5 seconds Â±100ms)
- Should not interfere with starting new workouts after dismissal
- Must integrate with existing stop workout flow without performance impact
