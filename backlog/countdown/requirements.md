# Countdown Requirements

## Overview
A 5-second preparation countdown that displays after clicking start, giving users time to get into position before the workout officially begins. The countdown appears in the status pop-up and integrates seamlessly with the existing workout flow.

## User Stories

### STORY-001: Start Workout with Preparation Time
As a workout user
I want a 5-second countdown after clicking start
So that I have time to get into proper position before the workout begins

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given the workout is in idle state, when I click start, then the camera and pose detection activate immediately
2. Given I clicked start, when the countdown begins, then I see numbers counting down from 5 to 1 in the status pop-up
3. Given the countdown is active, when it reaches 0, then the workout status changes from idle to active and exercise tracking begins
4. Given the countdown is running, when I observe the display, then I see only clean numbers (5, 4, 3, 2, 1) without additional text
5. Given the countdown completes, when the workout starts, then pose detection and exercise analysis are fully operational

### STORY-002: Preview Integration During Countdown
As a workout user  
I want the preview to activate during countdown
So that I can see myself and adjust my position before the workout starts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given the preview is not active, when I click start, then the preview activates simultaneously with the countdown
2. Given the preview is already active, when I click start, then the countdown begins without interrupting the preview
3. Given the countdown is running, when I look at the video feed, then I can see the pose detection overlay working
4. Given the countdown is active, when the preview is running, then the workout remains in idle status until countdown completes

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Countdown timing should be reasonably accurate (within ~100ms tolerance)
- Visual countdown display should be clear and prominent in the status pop-up
- No audio feedback required in initial implementation
- Integration must not interfere with existing camera/pose detection performance
