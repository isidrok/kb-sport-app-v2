- [DONE] unsubscribe removes listener
- [DONE] multiple listeners called
- [DONE] base event class stores data

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- None yet

### Notes

## Component: useEventBus Hook

### Tests
- [DONE] publish calls EventBus
- [DONE] subscribe adds listener and cleans up

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- None yet

### Notes

## Component: LoadModelUseCase

### Tests
- [DONE] publishes loading event on start
- [DONE] publishes ready event on success  
- [DONE] publishes error event on failure
- [DONE] initializes prediction adapter

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- None yet

### Notes
Preloads ML model with loading/ready/error event feedback.

## Component: StartCameraUseCase

### Tests
- [DONE] publishes requesting camera event on start
- [DONE] starts camera and publishes ready event  
- [DONE] publishes error event on camera access denied

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- Updated plan.md to move dimension setting responsibility to WorkoutService

### Notes
StartCameraUseCase complete. Handles camera operations with proper event publishing for requesting/ready/error states. Error handling includes message propagation and re-throwing for upstream handling.

## Component: StopCameraUseCase

### Tests
- [DONE] stops camera adapter

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- Removed unnecessary double-stop test (not a valid use case)

### Notes
StopCameraUseCase complete. Simple cleanup component that delegates to camera adapter stop method.

## Component: StartWorkoutUseCase

### Tests
- [DONE] throws if workout not idle
- [DONE] starts workout and publishes event
- [DONE] sets workout start time

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- None yet

### Notes
StartWorkoutUseCase complete. Validates workout state, starts workout, publishes status event with proper timing verification.

## Component: StopWorkoutUseCase

### Tests
- [DONE] throws if workout not active
- [DONE] stops workout and publishes event
- [DONE] sets workout end time

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- None yet

### Notes
StopWorkoutUseCase complete. Validates workout state, stops workout, publishes status event with proper timing verification.

## Component: ProcessFrameUseCase

### Tests
- [DONE] processes frame when model ready
- [DONE] renders poses to canvas
- [DONE] skips processing when model not ready

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- Fixed method names: isInitialized() and process() instead of isReady/predict

### Notes
ProcessFrameUseCase complete. Handles ML pose detection with proper adapter integration and null-checking for uninitialized model.

## Component: GetWorkoutStatusUseCase

### Tests
- [DONE] returns workout stats
- [DONE] can start when idle
- [DONE] can stop when active

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- None yet

### Notes
GetWorkoutStatusUseCase complete. Pure query use case that transforms workout entity data into UI-friendly stats with action availability flags.

## Component: WorkoutService

### Tests
- [DONE] creates workout on initialization
- [DONE] sets video canvas dimensions from client rect
- [DONE] start workout calls camera and workout use cases
- [DONE] stop workout calls camera and workout use cases
- [DONE] delegates process frame to use case
- [DONE] returns workout stats

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: Yes

### Refactorings Applied
- Extracted setElementDimensions method for better readability
- Refactored constructor to use object parameter instead of multiple parameters
- Added singleton export pattern

### Notes
WorkoutService complete. Application service that coordinates all workout-related use cases with proper dependency injection pattern and singleton export for easy consumption.
