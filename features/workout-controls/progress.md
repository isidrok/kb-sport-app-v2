# Implementation Progress

## Current Status
Working on: StartWorkoutUseCase
Phase: Phase 2 - Application Layer Use Cases

## Component: WorkoutEntity

### Tests
- [DONE] creates workout with idle status
- [DONE] start workout sets active status and start time
- [DONE] stop workout sets stopped status and end time
- [DONE] cannot start active workout
- [DONE] cannot stop idle workout

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- None yet

### Notes
Starting TDD implementation of workout-controls feature. Following plan.md sequence.

## Component: EventBus Infrastructure

### Tests
- [DONE] publish calls registered listeners
- [DONE] unsubscribe removes listener
- [DONE] multiple listeners called
- [DONE] base event class stores data

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- None yet

### Notes
Implementing lightweight event system for async communication between layers.

## Component: useEventBus Hook

### Tests
- [DONE] publish calls EventBus
- [DONE] subscribe adds listener and cleans up

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- None yet

### Notes
Easy event subscription/publishing from components with automatic cleanup.

## Component: LoadModelUseCase

### Tests
- [DONE] publishes loading event on start
- [DONE] publishes ready event on success  
- [DONE] publishes error event on failure
- [DONE] initializes prediction adapter

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- None yet

### Notes
Preloads ML model with loading/ready/error event feedback.

## Component: StartCameraUseCase

### Tests
- [DONE] publishes requesting camera event on start
- [DONE] starts camera and publishes ready event  
- [DONE] publishes error event on camera access denied

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- Updated plan.md to move dimension setting responsibility to WorkoutService

### Notes
StartCameraUseCase complete. Handles camera operations with proper event publishing for requesting/ready/error states. Error handling includes message propagation and re-throwing for upstream handling.

## Component: StopCameraUseCase

### Tests
- [DONE] stops camera adapter

### Documentation
- API documentation: Complete
- Complex logic documented: N/A

### Refactorings Applied
- Removed unnecessary double-stop test (not a valid use case)

### Notes
StopCameraUseCase complete. Simple cleanup component that delegates to camera adapter stop method.
