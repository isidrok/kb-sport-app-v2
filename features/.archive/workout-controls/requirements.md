# Workout Start/Stop Controls Requirements

## Overview
A floating start/stop button that controls workout sessions with camera-based pose detection. The button manages the complete workout lifecycle from ML model loading through camera access to pose analysis and rendering.

## User Stories

### STORY-001: Initialize Application with Model Loading
As a user opening the workout app
I want the ML model to preload automatically 
So that I can start my workout once everything is ready

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given the app is loading, when the page loads, then a status popup displays "Loading ML model..."
2. Given the ML model is loading, when I see the start button, then it should be disabled
3. Given the ML model loads successfully, when loading completes, then the status popup disappears and start button becomes enabled
4. Given the ML model fails to load, when the error occurs, then status popup shows "Model failed to load. Please reload the page" and remains visible
5. Given the model load fails, when I see the start button, then it remains permanently disabled

### STORY-002: Start Workout Session
As a user with a loaded ML model
I want to click the start button to begin my workout
So that I can track my kettlebell exercises with pose detection

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given the model is loaded and start button is enabled, when I click "Start", then button becomes disabled and shows loading state
2. Given I clicked start, when camera access is requested, then status popup shows "Requesting camera access..."
3. Given camera access is granted, when video stream starts flowing, then button label changes to "Stop" and becomes enabled
4. Given camera access is granted, when video is flowing, then pose analysis begins and poses render on canvas
5. Given camera access is denied, when permission fails, then status popup shows "Please grant camera access to start workout" and remains visible
6. Given camera access fails, when error occurs, then start button returns to enabled "Start" state

### STORY-003: Stop Workout Session  
As a user in an active workout session
I want to click the stop button to end my workout
So that I can finish my session and free up camera resources

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given workout is active with "Stop" button visible, when I click "Stop", then workout stops immediately without confirmation
2. Given I click stop, when workout ends, then camera stream stops
3. Given I click stop, when workout ends, then canvas clears of all pose overlays
4. Given I click stop, when workout ends, then button label changes back to "Start" and remains enabled

### STORY-004: Floating Button Display
As a user on any device
I want the workout button to be prominently displayed and accessible
So that I can easily control my workout regardless of screen size

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given any screen size, when I view the app, then the button appears at center bottom of screen
2. Given the button is displayed, when I view it, then it has a frosted glass visual effect
3. Given I'm on mobile or desktop, when I view the button, then it maintains center bottom position responsively
4. Given the button is in any state, when displayed, then it floats above other content

## Edge Cases

**Model Loading:**
- When model loading takes longer than expected, then status popup remains visible with loading message
- When network connection fails during model load, then show model load failure message

**Camera Access:**
- When user has no camera device, then status popup shows "No camera detected. Camera required for workout tracking"
- When camera is already in use by another application, then treat as camera access denied
- When user grants then immediately revokes camera permission, then show "Please grant camera access to start workout"

**Button State Management:**
- When clicking start multiple times rapidly, then only process first click and ignore subsequent clicks until state resolves
- When app is in any error state, then start button behavior depends on error type (disabled for model errors, enabled for camera errors)

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Visual Design:**
- Button should have frosted glass effect with appropriate transparency and blur
- Loading states should provide clear visual feedback to user
- Status popup should be clearly visible and readable on all screen sizes

**Responsiveness:**
- Button positioning must work across mobile and desktop screen sizes
- Touch targets should be appropriately sized for mobile interaction
- Visual effects should perform smoothly on target devices

**User Experience:**
- State transitions should be immediate and clear to user
- Error messages should be actionable where possible
- Loading states should prevent user confusion about app status
