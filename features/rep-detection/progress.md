# Implementation Progress

## Current Status
Working on: Application Layer - Phase 2
Phase: Planning DetectRepUseCase implementation

## Phase 1: Domain Layer - Rep Detection Core (COMPLETED)

### Component: Rep Type Addition ✅ COMPLETED
**Purpose**: Type definition for repetition data in workout types
**Stories Covered**: STORY-001 (rep data structure)

**Tests Completed:**
- ✅ Type checking handled by TypeScript compiler

**Implementation:**
```typescript
export type Rep = {
  hand: 'left' | 'right' | 'both'
  timestamp: Date
}
```

### Component: WorkoutEntity Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED
**Purpose**: Store repetitions as part of workout data
**Stories Covered**: STORY-001 (rep storage)

**Tests Completed:**
- ✅ `workout starts with empty reps` - Initial state validation
- ✅ `add rep increases count` - Adding reps updates array
- ✅ `get rep count returns total` - Count matches array length

**Public API Implemented:**
```typescript
get reps(): Rep[]
addRep(rep: Rep): void
getRepCount(): number
```

### Component: RepDetectionStateMachine ✅ COMPLETED
**Purpose**: Encapsulates the state transition logic for detecting valid repetitions
**Stories Covered**: STORY-001 (state machine requirements)

**Tests Completed:**
- ✅ `initial state is down` - Validates machine starts in down state
- ✅ `stays in down when wrists below nose` - No transition when wrists stay below nose
- ✅ `transitions to up when wrists above nose` - State changes after 300ms threshold
- ✅ `detects rep after being up for 300ms` - Rep counted when reaching up position (corrected logic)
- ✅ `both hands priority over single` - Both-hand detection takes precedence
- ✅ `ignores low confidence keypoints` - Tests custom confidence threshold
- ✅ `uses custom minimum duration` - Tests custom timing requirements

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Configurable confidence threshold (default: 0.5) and minimum state duration (default: 300ms)
- Rep detection after being in up position for minimum duration (not on transition)
- Hand priority logic: both > left > right
- Prevents double counting with rep detection flag per up cycle
- State machine with proper timing using `performance.now()`

**Public API:**
```typescript
constructor(confidenceThreshold: number = 0.5, minStateDuration: number = 300)
processKeyPoints(keyPoints: RepKeyPoints): StateTransitionResult
getCurrentState(): RepState
reset(): void
```

### Component: RepDetectionService ✅ COMPLETED
**Purpose**: Domain service coordinating rep detection using the state machine
**Stories Covered**: STORY-001, STORY-003 (100% accuracy)

**Tests Completed:**
- ✅ `returns null when no rep detected` - No false positives
- ✅ `returns rep when detected` - Successful detection
- ✅ `extracts keypoints from prediction` - Correct keypoint mapping from YOLOv8 format
- ✅ `handles missing keypoints` - Graceful null handling
- ✅ `reset clears state machine` - Reset functionality

**Key Features Implemented:**
- YOLOv8 keypoints mapping: nose=0, left_wrist=9, right_wrist=10
- Proper keypoints extraction with confidence values
- Null safety for missing keypoints
- Rep creation with hand and timestamp
- State machine reset delegation
- Singleton export for dependency injection

**Public API:**
```typescript
detectRep(prediction: Prediction): Rep | null
reset(): void
```

## Next Phase: Application Layer - Use Cases

### Component: DetectRepUseCase (PENDING)
**Purpose**: Bridge between application services and domain rep detection
**Stories Covered**: STORY-001 (integration with pose processing)

### Component: WorkoutStats Enhancement (PENDING)
**Purpose**: Add rep count to existing workout stats
**Stories Covered**: STORY-002 (displaying rep count)

### Component: WorkoutService Enhancement (PENDING)
**Purpose**: Integrate rep detection into frame processing pipeline
**Stories Covered**: STORY-001 (automatic counting)

## Risk Mitigation Implemented
- ✅ **Timing accuracy**: Using `performance.now()` for millisecond precision
- ✅ **State consistency**: State machine ensures no invalid transitions
- ✅ **Performance**: Process only when confidence threshold met
- ✅ **Double counting**: Priority checking (both → left → right) prevents duplicates
- ✅ **Partial visibility**: Handle cases where only one wrist is visible
- ✅ **Low confidence**: Maintain state during temporary confidence drops
- ⏳ **UI reactivity**: Will leverage existing WorkoutStatusEvent system for real-time updates

## Notes
- All Phase 1 components follow TDD methodology with comprehensive test coverage
- RepDetectionStateMachine corrected to detect reps after 300ms in up position (not on transition)
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Application Layer integration
